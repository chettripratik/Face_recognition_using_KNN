# Face_recognition_using_KNN
This project implements a face recognition system using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) machine learning algorithm. Faces are detected, preprocessed, and converted into feature vectors. KNN classifies a new face by comparing it with stored samples and identifying the closest matches based on distance.
